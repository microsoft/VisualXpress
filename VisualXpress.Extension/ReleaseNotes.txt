  opened move operation
* Fixing culture specific file path comparisons to be invariant across machines

* Fixing property expansion when setting VisualXpressExtensionGallery

[Version 2.11.2.0]
* Significant reduction in startup time for commands using p4v such as showing
  file history, revgraph, timelapse. To get the best startup performance, the 
  p4v process's P4 environment variables also needed to be set, not just on cmd line.  

[Version 2.11.1.0]
* Enabling and fixing all code analysis warnings to correct issues calling UI functions
  from a thread other than the main thread
* Enabling warnings as errors, all configurations, no project warning exclusions

  version as defined within a shared AssemblyInfo.cs. This version is also used as the 
  assembly version for VisualXpress

[Version 2.11.0]
* Major refactor of VisualXpress projects to migrated to Visual Studio 2022 project 
  with version specific VSSDK packages supporting 2017 (x86), 2019 (x86), and 2022 (x64).
  This also introduces VS version specific private gallery, which we can automatically
  path using $(VisualStudioEditionYear) when expanding $(VisualXpressExtensionGallery).
  The build root for the gallery to deploy is created within ".\intermediate\deploy\..."

[Version 2.10.3]
* VisualXpress extension support for Visual Studio 2022 Preview 6

[Version 2.10.0]
* Initial open source release to GitHub [https://github.com/microsoft/VisualXpress]
* Migrating Nuget packages.config to PackageReference

[Version 2.9.27]
* Fixing bug where p4vc.exe could be incorrectly located and used on machine
  outside of perforce installation folder

[Version 2.9.26]
* Adding support for P4V 2021.1 and the removal of p4vc.exe. This change is
  backwards compatible with P4V 2020 versions.

[Version 2.9.25]
* Fixing "Open User Settings" command to correctly open path with spaces
* Addition of UE5 menu commands for perforce operations
* Removing Gears MegaXGE build menu items from global config

[Version 2.9.24]
* Adding work-around for behaviour 16.8 which caused the VisualXpress toolbar 
  visibility state to be invisible, and not persist after closing/opening VS.

[Version 2.9.23]
* Fixing unspecified exception on commands when "Save All Documents" is enabled
* Fixing development PostBuild install to handle uninstallation of previous VS versions

[Version 2.9.22]
* Fixing PluginCommands previously using "p4v.exe -cmd" for displaying history and revgraph.
  As of P4V 2020.2 it is no longer supported. "p4vc.exe" commands are used now.
* Fixing "Reconcile - UE4" command to include common new source folders
* Addition of command "XboxOne GDK Command Prompt Here.."

[Version 2.9.21]
* Fixing bug where VisualXpress could sometimes delete the local temp file used by
  the external diff tool, before the intended process has loaded it.

[Version 2.9.20]
* Fixing async package loading race where VisualXpress could ignore perforce configuration
  from solution options if initialized after solution load

[Version 2.9.19]
* Added new "The Coalition" submenu with common Diff vs branch utilities
* Fixing bug where local readonly temp file for diff would fail to delete

[Version 2.9.18]
* The prevdiff command, used by "Diff Against Have Revision", now follows pending 
  integration history of files open for add when deriving previous revision to use
  for diff. This is helpfull for comparing changes after integrating files as add with
  edit to a new path, either resolved or unresolved.
* Pruning the menu items for diff versus UE4 releases
* The "Reconcile: UE4" menu option now includes TheCoalition Plugins and ReferenceGame

[Version 2.9.17]
* Now using VisualStudio.Setup.Configuration.Interop to find IDE install paths for
  build deployments
* Fixing undefined scheduler usage for StatusBar timings
* PluginCommandCompare now supports using both search/replace and branch together.
  The matching branch view mapping takes precedence. The p4-contoso server now
  contains a branchspec "visualxpress_to_ue4_main" which is used for the command
  "Perforce - Diff vs UE4/Main". This allows us to customize specific file mappings
  as needed, such as when files are moved in //UE4/Main/...

  release candidate changes for VS 2019 with AsyncPackage support.

  copying perforce depot path, and copying folder path.

[Version 2.9.3]
* Remapped debug fast link options to match the changes in UBT. bUseFastPDBLinking

  for all configs and bUseFastPDBLinkingForTest only turns it on for the Test config
* Addition of menu item setting InsertBefore, as well as support for preserving

  makes for an easier way to insert items around existing separators.

  can be used together without issue now.
